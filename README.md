In summer 2021, I will be working on a research project involving insecticide resistance in Grape Berry Moths in the Lake Erie region. Specifically, I will be investigating the effect of ABC transport inhibitors on the LC50 of GBMs when treated with common insecticides.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy playing drums, which I've been doing so for over 12 years.
